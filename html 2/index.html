           <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

I am currently studying in Shikshadeep Higher Secondary Boarding School. I completed my Sophomore year from St. Mary's school, Biratnagar. I have lately been practicing programming languages such as C, C++, scripting language such as JavaScript, PHP, Python & markup languages such as HTML & CSS. I have been learning coding since my school years. I have designed a couple of websites for small businesses, artists & organisations before. Besides coding, sketching, photography & painting profoundly interest me. I am also a fitness enthusiast.</p>
